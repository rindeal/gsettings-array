# Installation

You have several options to install the GSettings Array Utility:

## Using pip

```bash
pip install gsettings-array
```

## Using poetry

```bash
poetry add gsettings-array
```

## Direct download

You can still download the script directly as a single self-contained file:

```bash
wget https://github.com/rindeal/gsettings-array/raw/main/gsettings_array.py
chmod +x gsettings_array.py
```

**Note:** Regardless of the installation method, you need to have the `pygobject` Python library installed on your system.
